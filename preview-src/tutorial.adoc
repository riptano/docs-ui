== Objective

Learn how to create a new database, connect to your database, load a set of vector embeddings, and perform a similarity search to find vectors that are close to the one in your query.

== Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have an {astra-link}[active Astra account] with the requisite permissions.

. Install the Python SDK and open a Python REPL.
+
[source,shell]
----
pip install astra-vector
----
+
[source,shell]
----
python
----
+
[TIP]
====
Additional clients, such as {astra-nodejs-link}[Node.js] and {astra-json-link}[JSON API], are available.
====

. Connect to Astra and create a database.
+
[source,python]
----
import astra_vector

# Authenticate to the SaaS database
api_key = 'your_api_key'
client = astra_vector.Client(api_key)

# Create a new database
database_name = 'my_vector_database'
client.create_database(database_name)

# Connect to the database
db = client.connect(database_name)

# Create a new table for vectors
table_name = 'vector_data'
db.create_table(table_name)
----

== Core steps

. Prepare and ingest data.
+
[source,python]
----
# Load sample vector data
sample_vectors = [
    {'id': 1, 'vector': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]},
    {'id': 2, 'vector': [0.4, 0.5, 0.7]}
]

for data in sample_vectors:
    db.insert_record(table_name, data)
----

. Perform a similarity search.
+
[source,python]
----
# Run a similarity search
query_vector = [0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
results = db.similarity_search(table_name, query_vector, k=5)
----

. Show the results.
+
[source,python]
----
# Similarity search results
for result in results:
    print(f"ID: {result['id']}, Similarity Score: {result['score']}")
----

== Cleanup

. Delete all resources.
+
[source,python]
----
# Delete the table
db.delete_table(table_name)
print(f"Table '{table_name}' deleted.")

# Delete the database
client.delete_database(database_name)
print(f"Database '{database_name}' deleted.")
----

== Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to:

* [*] Create a new database
* [*] Connect to your database
* [*] Load a set of vector embeddings
* [*] Perform a similarity search to find vectors that are close to the one in your query

You're well on your way to becoming an Astra Vector expert!
