== Overview

By integrating LangChain with Astra, you can seamlessly utilize advanced linguistic processing capabilities of LangChain within the Astra vector database environment.
This combination enhances vector data analysis, allowing natural language data to be processed, stored, and queried with efficiency.

To get started, ensure you have an https://example.com[active LangChain account] with the requisite permissions.

You will also need an https://example.com[active LangChain account] an access to its API keys.

== Setup

[.step]
=== Acquire API key from LangChain

Log into your LangChain dashboard and navigate to the 'API' section to obtain your API key.

[.step]
=== Configure Astra's SDK for LangChain

[source,python]
----
from astra import VectorDB
db = VectorDB(config='astra_config.yaml')
db.set_integration('LangChain', api_key='YOUR_LANGCHAIN_API_KEY')
----

[.step]
=== Initialize data transfer

[source,python]
----
db.sync_from('LangChain')
----

== Verify integration

Ensure your integration was successful by checking for new linguistic vector entries in your Astra database:

. Navigate to the Astra dashboard.
. Open the 'Vector Data' tab.
. Confirm the appearance of recent vector entries from LangChain.
