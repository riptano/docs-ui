[CAUTION]
======
Admonition styles are set on example blocks, which are delimited by four equal signs (`====`).
When nesting a delimited block that uses the same structural container, it's necessary to vary the length of the delimiter lines (i.e., make the length of the delimiter lines for the child block different than the length of the delimiter lines for the parent block).
Varying the delimiter line length allows the parser to distinguish one block from another.
