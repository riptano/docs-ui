== Level 1 section title (Discrete)

[.rolename]
=== Example: Section title w/ custom role

////
When the document type is article (the default), the document can only have one level 0 section title (`=`), which is the document title (i.e., doctitle).

When a page is converted to HTML, each section title becomes a heading element where the heading level matches the number of equals signs.
For example, a level 1 section (`==`) maps to an `<h2>` HTML tag.

Each section title has an auto-generated section ID that forms the fragment identifier for the section.
The auto-generated section ID is a URL-safe version of the section title, converted to lowercase, with all non-alphanumeric characters replaced with hyphens (controlled by the `idprefix` and `idseparator` attributes).
An anchor (empty link) is added before the section title, and an anchor icon floats to the left of the section title (controlled by the `sectanchors` attribute).

Section titles appear in the page table of contents (TOC) in the order they appear in the document.
The depth of the page TOC can be configured using the `page-toclevels` attribute.

A `discrete` heading is declared and styled in a manner similar to that of a section title, but itâ€™s not part of the section hierarchy and not included in the table of contents,etc.

== Links

=== Internal link

Instead of having to enclose text within <<text-formatting,tags or special characters>>, you can focus on expressing your ideas and content in a clear and concise manner.

=== External link

////
An _external link_ is any link that targets an address outside of the docs.datastax.com subdomain.
External links should have the following behavior, regardless of any AsciiDoc attributes that a writer might apply to them:

* Different visual styling than an internal link, e.g. an `open_in_new` icon after the link text.
* Open in a new tab or window when clicked.

The links in the example sentences above all target the same external URL -- `\https://www.datastax.com`.
However, they each have different AsciiDoc attributes applied to them.

https://www.datastax.com[distinguish each paragraph^]

The UI should disregard these attributes and apply the same styling and behavior to each link.
