= Lang Chain

== Overview

By integrating LangChain with Astra, you can seamlessly 
utilize advanced linguistic processing capabilities of 
LangChain within the Astra vector database environment. 
This combination enhances vector data analysis, 
allowing natural language data to be processed, 
stored, and queried with efficiency.

To get started, ensure you have an 
https://example.com[active LangChain account,role=external] with the requisite permissions.

You will also need an https://example.com[active LangChain account,role=external] 
an access to its API keys.

== Setup

=== [.step]#1# Acquire API Key from LangChain:

Log into your LangChain dashboard and navigate to the 'API' section to obtain your API key.

=== [.step]#2# Configure Astra's SDK for LangChain

[source,python]
----
from astra import VectorDB
db = VectorDB(config='astra_config.yaml')
db.set_integration('LangChain', api_key='YOUR_LANGCHAIN_API_KEY')
----

=== [.step]#3# Initialize Data Transfer

[source,python]
----
db.sync_from('LangChain')
----

== Verify Integration

Ensure your integration was successful by checking for new linguistic vector entries in your Astra database:

. Navigate to the Astra dashboard.
. Open the 'Vector Data' tab.
. Confirm the appearance of recent vector entries from LangChain.
