= Tailwind CSS

This project uses https://tailwindcss.com/[TailwindCSS] for styling. Tailwind classes can also be used on our docs site to style content within AsciiDoc files.

== How it works

In preview mode running `gulp preview`:

1. The tailwind.config.js file at the root of the project is used to configure Tailwind.
2. Tailwind CSS is compiled to browser-ready CSS using postcss within the preview-src build task.

On datastax-docs-site using the UI bundle:

1. The tailwind.config.js file is packaged into the UI bundle
2. The tailwind css files are collected into site.css in the UI bundle but NOT compiled to CSS with postcss, that is handled on the docs site repo.
3. The datastax-docs-site repo uses the tailwind CLI to scan built html pages for production.
  * The tailwind.config.js file within the UI bundle is used to configure Tailwind.
  * site.css within the UI bundle is targeted by the CLI command to build the included tailwind CSS into browser-ready CSS, discarding any unsued classes.

== Why Tailwind?

* It offers a framework of utility classes that provides a system for building pages that is well documented and easy to use.
* Because it is primarily classes, we can use them to style our Asciidoc content without having to write custom CSS in the UI bundle.

== How to use Tailwind

Within Asciidoc tailwind classses can be used on anything that allows a `role` attribute passed to it. For example:

[source,adoc]
----
[.mb-2.p-3]
I am a parapgraph with a margin-bottom of 2rem and padding of 3rem. Because of how we configured tailwind 1rem = 8px.
----

[source,adoc]
----
image::images/hero.png[role="w-full h-auto mb-2"]
----

Often when you apply a role, it gets applied to a parent container and not the element you intended to style. Tailwind offers a child selector modifier to help with this. For example:

[source,adoc]
----
[.[&>h2]:!border-0]
== An h2 heading that you don't want a bottom border on
----

* The heading `==` macro applies roles to a parent container in the resulting HTML. If we want to style the h2 in a certain way, like having no bottom border, we can use the child selector modifier `&>` to target the h2 within the parent container.
* Antora styles often have a higher specificity than Tailwind styles. To override Antora styles, you can use the `!` modifier to apply the Tailwind style with `!important`.

== Custom components

Sometimes it makes sense to create custom classes for UI elements that are used in many places.

=== `btn`

A link styled as various button colors and variants

[source,adoc]
----
https://astra.datastax.com[Primary Color Solid Variant,role="btn btn-primary btn-solid"]

https://astra.datastax.com[Neutral Color Outlined Varaint^,role="btn btn-primary btn-outlined"]
----

=== `text`

We offer a set of classes to style text as defined in our design system

[source,adoc]
----
text-display text-h1 text-h2 text-h3 text-h4 text-h5 text-body text-body-small text-caption text-label text-overline text-button text-tab text-mono text-mono-small
----

Style an h3 heading as an h2

[source,adoc]
----
[.[&>h3]:!text-h2]
=== I'm an h3 heading that looks like an h2
----
